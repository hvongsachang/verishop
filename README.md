Welcome to Verishop.  We're here to make shopping easier.

First, let's make an account.  You can click register in the upper right corner to create your account.

If you do have an account, please log in via the super accessible login screen, otherwise the default index screen.

Now, you should be directed to our home page.  You shouldn't see any items here - just a table header.  Let's add some items to your
shopping list!

Direct your attention to the upper left hand corner, and there should be a navigation button called "Add Items".  Clicking on it
should redirect you to a another page where you can add an item.  Please indicate the name of the item, the store from which you
want to buy it from, and the quantity wanted.  Click on "Add Item". Now you should be redirected to the home page and see the item
you wanted listed.

Now, just in case the store from which you wanted to buy your item of interest does not exist, you will be flashed a warning telling
you the store was not found.  That means the store is not in our database.  To add the store, you can go to "Check Store" in the
navigation bar and type in the store of interest.  If it truly does not exist in our database, then you will be asked if you would
like to add it. Click yes to add when prompted, and now you can add the item from the store you just added.  Just click back on the
"Add Items" tab.

Once you amassed your long list of shopping items you want to buy during the next shopping season, you are ready.  Once you want to
head out and go shopping, click on the "Go Shopping!" tab.  Enter when prompted the store you are shopping at, and press "Generate
Shopping List".  A new page should pop up of all the items you would like to get at that specific location.

You will also notice as you navigate the index page and the final shopping list page that we have update buttons.  Click on these
and a new part of the webpage will appear.  Depending on what item you chose to edit, it will produce the current properties of the
item.  From there, you can change anything, as long as the quantity is above 0.

And that should be it!  Happy Shopping!
